# Assignment 1: Analysing F1 Data hosted in AWS S3 using Databricks and PySpark

## Objectives

* Explore and gain familiarity with F1 Dataset and PySpark
* Answer simple questions about the F1 Data:
  + What was the average time each driver spent at the pit stop for each race?
  + Rank the average time spent at the pit stop in order of who won each race
  + Insert the missing code (e.g: ALO for Alonso) for drivers based on the
   'drivers' dataset
  + Who is the youngest and oldest driver for each race? Create a new column
   called “Age”
  + For a given race, which driver has the most wins and losses?
  + Continue exploring the data by answering your own question (Which
    constructor clinched pole position most often?)
